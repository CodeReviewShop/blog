## Introduction

The learning curve of studying programming languages is exponential rather than linear. It is common for students to say "I don't get all this", "Why can't everything be done in python?", "Why do I need C/C++" or "Java is the worst". These are valid thoughts on the part of the individual, but ultimately this happens because we forget, or are not taught the essence of programming. Programming was invented to solve problems. If this fundamental truth is lost, we tend to see programming languages as the solution rather than a tool.

## Overview

All programming languages are built on the core principles and fundamental concepts of logic. In this article, we are going to highlight these core concepts and try to break them down so we can get a sense of what they are all about.

We can look the structure of programming languages in four categories:

1. Basics.
2. Intermediate.
3. Language specific features.
4. Advanced.

Disclaimer! I will make a lot of references to Python, Java and Go.

## Basics

- Data types / primitives
- Expressions
- Assignments
- Variables
- Constants
- Input/Output statements
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Data structures / collection types
- Functions

## Intermediate

- Data streams. E.g. files
- Error handling
- Testing
- Pointers

## Language Specific Features 

- Built-in functions / libraries
- Other features. E.g. How certain features are implemented. (Interfaces, structs, lists ...)

## Advanced 

- Packages
- Modules
- Build
- Use of frameworks
- Design patterns
- Programming paradigms

## Concluding Thoughts 

The challenge is not that we lack the ability to learn, but there is so much content out there that we get distracted, rather than finding them helpful. We end up being able to 'build' software without a solid foundation in the fundamentals. It is no fault of ours. The layers of abstraction resulting from the advancement of technology have made us reluctant to understand the basics of software development.

### The Way Forward

Do we have to understand how everything works under the hood? Yeah, that would be great, but it's not practical. Of course, there are programmers who understand how everything works, and learning multiple languages is a breeze for them.

However, we are all not the same. On a levelled field, to get good at learning multiple programming languages, you can begin by mastering the basic structure of programming languages. It is consistent in all languages. The same applies to the Intermediate concepts, however, the variation between different languages starts to become clear. It's the same application, but with a different approach.

After getting those covered, you can now focus on learning the built-in of a language. This includes libraries, functions, and methods packaged with the language. From there, you can tackle the advanced concepts.

I hope this helps you as you transition or learn other programming languages. Until we meet in the next article, keep solving problems.
