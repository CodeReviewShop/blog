## About Me

I am a curious learner who loves to solve problems with code. I am an advocate for open source software and data privacy. And you guessed right, I use linux ðŸ™ƒ. I spend most of my time creating/customizing tools for my terminal workflow.
We're programmers, we don't have to work hard, we need only to be smart.

## Why Code Review Shop?

CodeReviewShop is my medium of giving back to the community. I do not just want to see students getting by with programming, I want to see students grow with a solid foundation of the concepts and tools we use in the industry. For an overview of our services, check out our [website](https://codereviewshop.web.app).
